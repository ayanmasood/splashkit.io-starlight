To get SplashKit installed on Windows, follow the two steps:

import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<CardGrid>
<LinkCard
	title="Install the WSL"
	description="Step 1"
	href="/installation/windows/wsl/step-1/"
/>
<LinkCard
	title="Install SplashKit SDK"
	description="Step 2"
	href="/installation/windows/wsl/step-2/"
/>
</CardGrid >


Once you have all of these steps complete you should be setup and ready to
start building SplashKit applications in the language of your choice.
